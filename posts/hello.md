## Getting Started

> To use AWS in these projects, we'll need to set up an account, the CLI, and the SDK.

### Create an account

If you don't already have an account then [sign up here](https://portal.aws.amazon.com/billing/signup#/start).

Once you are signed up, you should be able to log in to the [AWS Console](https://aws.amazon.com/console/). It might look overwhelming if you're seeing for the first time.
